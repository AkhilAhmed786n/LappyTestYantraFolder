Jenkins:
● It is a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool.
● In case of development, jenkins will be used to automate build creation and build testing and
build deployment process so it is called continuous deployment tool.

Jenkins usage in automation:
● In Automation, jenkins will be used in continuous integration process, it means jenkins will
always monitor the framework in git location, automatically creates a build and 
provides email notification if any changes had happened in the build.
● Jenkins can also be used to execute all the test scripts whenever new build arrives to testing
environment.

Jenkins provides three levels of execution:
1) On-demand
2) On-schedule
3) Poll-SCM (source code management)

1) On Demand:
● Based on the customer demand, login to jenkins and start the execution
2) On Schedule:
● Based on the schedule time which is given in the configure area, jenkins automatically triggers
build
3) Poll SCM:
● Poll means continuously monitor the framework or application in git location, it automatically
starts the execution whenever any changes happen in the framework or testing server

Note: Whenever jenkins starts the job execution, it will connect to git and download the entire
framework (build) into the local system and test the build by taking help of maven and execute all the
test scripts and sends out an email.
